# __Project: Wrangling and Analyze Data (WeRateDogs Dataset)__
### _By Abdullah Akintobi_

## __Introduction to the Dataset__ 

The dataset that you will be wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs Brent](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)."WeRateDogs has over 9 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains primary tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. The WerRateDog Twitter archive have been filtered to tweets with ratings only (there are now 2356 tweets).

Note: You can fine more information on the steps taken in the analysis in the `wrangle_report.pdf` file and the report of the analysis in the `act_report.pdf` (which contain all the visualization from the analysis).
